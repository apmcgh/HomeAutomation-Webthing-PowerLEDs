Module:     Compute-LED-calibration.py

Purpose:
    Use measurement results "LED measurements*.csv" to produce a "curve" that
    maps the intended brightness to the PWM duty cycle (LED intensity control
    value) in order to attempt to have as linear as possible a relationship
    between the "brightness" or "colour" values and the actual light emitted by
    the LEDs.
    Part of this is achieved by "calibrating", i.e. finding out the voltage
    output for a wide range of PWM values. This is the scientific part. The
    other part, the less sophiticated part, the subjective one, uses two
    parameters for each channel to attempt a best fit:
    1/ "zero" is the minimum PWM duty cycle required to light the channel at
    its lowest level.
    2/ "power" is a non linear bending of the curve, the higher the power thhe
    lower the curve goes in the middle, while keeping 0 and 1 as they are, this
    allows us to change the relative importance of the vraious channels so that
    they light up mostly proportionately to each other at various intensity
    levels.

Tests and adjustments:
    Every time a zero or a power is changed, this program must be run to
    produce the calibration curves and the webthing server must be restarted.
    It is possible to change the "curves" live via the "channel_curve" property,
    but I have not provided a user friendly means to do so.
    It's easier to just restart the webthing server.

    1/ Start the webthing server (webthing_dimmable_LED_strip.py), start the
    gateway, connect to it (browse to the gateway).
    Set the colour to pure white, then set the brightness to the minimum
    possible.
    All LED channels should be just lit a tiny bit, if not, adjust the zero
    values. If a zero value just a fraction smaller fails to light up its
    channel, then you have the right zero.

    2/ Set the colour to maximum saturation and value, then try various hues
    around the wheel.  Of particular interest are cyan, magenta and yellow. For
    instance if green dominates when the setting it for yellow, then the power
    for green must be increased or red decreased.

    3/ another way to test colour dominance is to set a colour to maximum
    value, then change the brightness (to 80%, 50%, 20%...) and see if the
    colour hue changes or only the intensity changes. If the hue changes so one
    channel comes to dominate, its power must be increased, or if a channel
    becomes too weak, then its power must be decreased.

Notes:
    1/ zeros are small values usually close to 0, most likely less than 0.1,
    they are most likely affected by the tolerance errors on the resistors of
    the MOSFET board (not tested)

    2/ powers should most likely be between 1 and 3, most probably close-ish to
    2. They are probably affected by the PWM resistor variance and by physics -
    the different LED wavelengths most likely respond differently to PWM and
    voltage, and their perceived brightness may not be solely correlated to the
    input voltage and waveform.

    3/ the values of zeros and powers in this file are only relevant for the
    hardware I used them on, they must be tailored to each and every distinct
    hardware set-up.

    4/ same goes with the measurements, these must be taken for each channel of
    each hardware set-up. See "PWM_and_MOSFET_calibration.py"
    I have taken the measurements with the LEDs connected (in technical jargon,
    with the "load" on). I did not try without the load so I cannot say which
    gives the best results.

History:
    2020-10-04: Full functionality: create calibration curves from a
                combination of channel voltage measurement and a few intuitive
                parameters (zeros, powers).

                Formatting to text width = 79 characters, pycodestyle
                Ignored some of the warnings - for higher legibility.

===============================================================================
Future:
    Nothing.

    This tool is used to fine tune the calibration curves with new hardware. As
    this is a hobby project, it is presently perfect in its imperfection:
    sufficiently good to do the job rather efficiently. Of course it is not
    production grade, it does not need to be.
